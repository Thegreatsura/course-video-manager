# Two database modes, chosen at launch and recorded in the run directory:
#   test clone   THE DEFAULT. launch clones the template named by VERIFY_DATABASE_URL
#                (exported, or in ~/.config/cvm/verify.env) into cvm_verify_<run id>,
#                the server runs on that clone, cleanup drops it. Writes are allowed.
#                No template, no run: launch fails and says to ask Matt.
#   PRODUCTION   only with `launch --production`. The server uses .env's DATABASE_URL
#                with default_transaction_read_only on, so it cannot write at all.
#
# Runs are independent: several can drive at once. A run belongs to the
# worktree that launched it — its directory is <worktree>/.verify/run-<id> and
# it records that worktree — and a verb run from any other checkout refuses it.
