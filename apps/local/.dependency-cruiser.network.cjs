// ADR 0032 section 6).
//
// A slow network or AI call the author walks away from is a Job, and the
// Sidecar runs it. `scripts/check-background-jobs.ts` (the `network` guard)
// counts every use of the global `fetch` and of the AI SDK, OpenAI, Anthropic
// and Cloudinary clients, file by file, against a shrink-only allowlist. These
// rules hold the module graph around it, so no wrapper can carry a client past
// that count:
//
// 1. A network client package is imported only by the files on the allowlist's
//    `network` list (read from `scripts/background-jobs-allowlist.json`, so the
//    two lists are one), by the extra entry points named below, and by the
//    Sidecar. A type-only import is not a client.
//
// 2. `app/` reaches the Sidecar only through `sidecar/job-specs.ts` (to
//    enqueue a Job) and what it imports, and never the dev scripts: the
//    `network` guard does not scan either, so neither may hold a call for it.
//
// ADR 0032 section 7 names every entry point, and
// tests/background-jobs-guard.test.ts fails if one is missing there.
