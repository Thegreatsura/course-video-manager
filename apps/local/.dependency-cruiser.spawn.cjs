// @ts-check
// THE SPAWN GUARD (docs/plans/background-jobs-sidecar.md, section 3.7, guard 1).
//
// Background work — an encode, an Overlay render, a Publish — runs in the
// Sidecar, never in a request a browser tab keeps alive. Two rules hold that
// at the module graph; the runtime half is `SidecarContext`, which the work
// asks for and only the Sidecar's layer provides.
//
// 1. Nothing a route can reach may reach the Sidecar's spawners: the ffmpeg
//    encode runner and the encodes built on it, the Overlay renderer
//    (Remotion's `bin.mjs`), the vertical Short, and the Sidecar's own layer
//    and Job handlers. A route enqueues a Job instead.
//
// 2. Outside the Sidecar (`sidecar/`), `child_process` is imported only by
//    the INTERACTIVE entry points, each named below with why it stays: a
//    person is waiting on it, it takes a moment, and it is not background
//    work. Anything else that needs to start a process is either one of
//    these, or a Job. The rule covers every module the graph reaches, not
//    just `app/`: the workspace packages (`packages/`, seen here as
//    `../../packages/…`) run inside the app server too.
//
// `@effect/platform`'s `Command` is the other way to start a process, and
// dependency-cruiser cannot see which export a module uses: that half is
// `scripts/check-background-jobs.ts` (the `spawn` guard), with the same
// entry points on its allowlist.
