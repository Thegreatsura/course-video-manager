/**
 * The Animatic's keys, and they are the VIDEO PAGE'S KEYS.
 *
 * The author moves between the two screens all day. A key that means "play the
 * thing I have selected" on one of them cannot mean nothing, or something else,
 * on the other — so every shortcut here is lifted from
 * `features/video-editor/hooks/use-keyboard-shortcuts.ts` and given the
 * Animatic's own equivalent of the same action. Only the keys that have such an
 * equivalent are here: the Animatic is read-only, so DELETE, ALT+ARROW (reorder)
 * and B (pause marker) have nothing to act on.
 *
 * ONE KEY PAIR DIFFERS ON PURPOSE: LEFT and RIGHT. On the Video page they are
 * a second UP and DOWN. Here they STEP THE PLAYHEAD to the previous or next
 * Clip Mockup, because the author watching the picture wants the picture to
 * move — and a selection is invisible with the list folded away, and cannot
 * land on a folded row at all. UP and DOWN keep the Video page's meaning.
 *
 * The same guard as the Video page decides when a key is not ours
 * (`shouldIgnoreKeyboardShortcut`), so typing in a field or a dialog never
 * plays the Animatic — with one exception. A click on the Player's own play
 * or fullscreen button leaves focus on that button, and the guard ignores keys
 * on a plain button. LEFT and RIGHT are let through from inside the stage
 * anyway, so the author's hand on the picture can still step it. Only those
 * two: the Player's speed menu reads UP, DOWN and RETURN for itself.
