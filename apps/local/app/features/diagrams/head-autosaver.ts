 * A store change is not an edit. `loadSnapshot` puts the loaded records under
 * the `"user"` source, and the store delivers them to listeners on the next
 * frame, after the load has returned — so a listener cannot tell opening a
 * diagram from drawing on it. The comparison against what was loaded is what
 * keeps a page that is only opened from writing.
 *
 * Each save names the stored head it replaces (by hash), and the server
 * refuses it if the head has since changed elsewhere: the autosaver never
 * overwrites a head it hasn't seen. Once refused, it stops saving until the
 * author picks a side — `flush({ overwrite: true })`, or a fresh `attach`.
 * Saves run one at a time, so each knows the hash the one before it left.
 *
 * It saves only while attached to a head. When to attach and detach — and so
 * whether the canvas may be edited — is the page reducer's decision
 * (`diagram-playground-reducer.ts`); this module only keeps the store honest.
