/**
 * The transcript of the clip you just recorded, top right of the glass.
 *
 * For reading back a take you got wrong: the words that actually came out,
 * next to the words you meant to say. The editor picks the clip (see
 * `session-latest-transcript.ts`) — the newest transcribed one in this
 * recording session, deleted ones included — and this only draws it.
 *
 * Small and dim, for the same reason the controls are: anything bright on the
 * glass is something you read around for the whole take. Never truncated: the
 * whole take wraps onto as many lines as it needs, and only a take taller than
 * the glass (less the controls strip at the bottom) scrolls inside the panel.
