/**
 * Keep the teleprompter popup in step with this editor.
 *
 * The popup has no picker, so this is the only way it learns which video to
 * show, what capture is doing, which of Script or Beats you're looking at, and
 * what this recording session's clips are doing, and how long the Video runs.
 *
 * Two effects, doing two different jobs:
 *
 *   - The first answers the popup's heartbeat, its join handshake and a dot
 *     clicked on the glass. State and the click handler are
 *     read through a ref rather than captured in the dependencies: the
 *     speech-detector state changes constantly mid-take, and re-subscribing the
 *     channel on every change is the one failure mode a teleprompter can't have.
 *   - The second *pushes* state the moment it changes, so the glass is never a
 *     heartbeat behind the editor. Its dependencies are the primitives rather
 *     than the state object, so a re-render that produces an identical
 *     `{ videoId, capture, tab }` sends nothing — which matters, because the
 *     speech detector re-renders far more often than it actually transitions.
