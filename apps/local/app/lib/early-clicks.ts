/**
 * Clicks that land before React hydrates.
 *
 * The server-rendered page paints its buttons 0.3–1.1s before React has
 * attached a single listener (the video editor is the slowest). A click
 * inside that window reaches no handler at all, and React never replays it:
 * the "first click after a page load is swallowed" bug.
 *
 * `captureEarlyClicks` runs as an inline `<script>` in the document head
 * (root.tsx), before the body is parsed. Until hydration commits it owns
 * every click whose default action the browser would not already have
 * performed: it buffers it and stops it there, so React (whose listeners may
 * already be attached but whose tree is not yet live) never half-handles it.
 * `replayEarlyClicks` runs from root Layout's effect, after hydration has
 * committed: it stops buffering and, a task later, dispatches the first
 * buffered click again — the full pointer/mouse sequence, so `onPointerDown`
 * triggers (Radix menus, selects) fire as well as `onClick` ones.
 *
 * Only the first: clicks after it are the user retrying a page that looked
 * dead, and replayed back to back in one task they would all get past a
 * button's own disable-while-busy guard — two clicks on "Post", two posts.
