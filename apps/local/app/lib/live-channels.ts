/**
 * The live channels on Matt's desk the browser connects to: the Stream Deck
 * forwarder hub (Stream Deck presses, teleprompter controls, browser
 * link-capture) and OBS. Every client reads its address from here, never from
 * a literal.
 *
 * The addresses are decided at build time by vite.config.ts (see
 * live-desk/live-desk.ts): the live desk in Matt's main checkout, the discard
 * port everywhere else, and an explicit `VITE_STREAM_DECK_HUB_URL` /
 * `VITE_OBS_WEBSOCKET_URL` over both — verify-cvm pins its runs that way. A
 * worktree's editor therefore never hears Matt's real button presses, and his
 * editor never hears it. The fallback here is the dead address too, so a build
 * that skipped the config still fails closed.
