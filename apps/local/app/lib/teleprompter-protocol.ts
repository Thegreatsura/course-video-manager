/**
 * Transport between the Video Editor and the teleprompter popup, built on
 * `popup-channel.ts` like `diagram-protocol.ts` (BroadcastChannel, same-origin,
 * no server). Deliberately a SEPARATE channel name from "cvm-diagrams" so the
 * two popups never parse each other's traffic.
 *
 * Two differences from the diagram protocol, both because the teleprompter is a
 * pure slave to the editor:
 *
 *   - There is no "load this video" command and no picker. `editorState` carries
 *     the editor's current videoId, so the main window is unconditionally the
 *     source of truth for what's on the glass. No video open in the editor means
 *     an empty teleprompter.
 *   - `editorState` also carries capture state, mirroring the editor's recording
 *     + silence-detection indicator so the same status is visible on the glass,
 *     the side panel's active tab, so the glass shows whichever of Script,
 *     Animatic or Beats you're looking at in the editor, and one mark per clip in the
 *     current recording session, so the glass can show clips landing, and the
 *     newest clip's transcript, so a take can be read back, and the Video's
 *     length so far, so the scope of the video is visible from the glass.
 *
 * State is **pushed, not polled**. `editorState` goes out when it changes, so
 * the glass is never more than a message behind the editor. The ping/pong
 * heartbeat exists only to answer "is the editor still there" — a pong carries
 * nothing, and a popup that is already attached learns everything by push.
 * `hello` is the handshake for the other join order: a popup opened after the
 * editor mounted missed the mount push, so it asks once, and keeps asking only
 * while it believes nobody is on the other end.
 *
 * One thing flows back the other way: a dot clicked on the glass
 * (`clipMarkClicked`). It is a fact, not a command: the editor decides whether
 * that plays or pauses the Clip, and the glass learns the outcome the same way
 * it learns everything else, from the next `editorState` (`playingClipId`).
 * The teleprompter never reports reading position.
