 * A STORAGE MOVE'S PARTIAL COPIES, AND WHO MAY DELETE THEM (#2169).
 *
 * A move writes each file to `<dest>.cvm-move-partial` first. Wasted space on
 * a drive is a bad outcome, so no partial may outlive the Job that made it —
 * but a Job may delete only the partials it can prove it made:
 *
 * - it RECORDS each partial (a `move-partial` Job Event) before creating it;
 * - only a recorded path is ever deleted, never a pattern over the drive;
 * - the path must end in exactly `.cvm-move-partial`, lie strictly inside
 *   `<target>/<folder>` once every link is resolved (`assertUnder`), the
 *   folder must really be that folder (`folderRefusal`), the target must be
 *   one of the configured Storage Roots, and the thing there a regular file.
