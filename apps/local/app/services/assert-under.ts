/**
 * The one guard between a path the app did not build itself — read from the
 * database, or out of a request — and a write or delete on disk.
 *
 * A thumbnail row stores an absolute `filePath`. On a verify-cvm test clone
 * that path still names Matt's real PNG, so a save that wrote straight to it
 * overwrote his file. Every write or delete of such a path goes through
 * `assertUnder` first, with the env-configured folder that kind of file lives
 * in (`VIDEO_FILES_DIR`, `CLIP_MOCKUP_DIR`, `FINISHED_VIDEOS_DIRECTORY`, …) —
 * the same folders verify-cvm points at its run's `scratch/`. A path outside
 * that folder is refused, so a clone can only ever touch its own scratch.
 *
 * `scripts/check-fs-writes.sh` fails any fs write, unlink or rm in routes and
 * services whose path did not come out of this helper.
