/**
 * **Clip transcription** (#12 in docs/plans/background-jobs-sidecar.md): the
 * named Clips go `transcribing`, then each is transcribed through Whisper on
 * its own and stored — its text, its Transcript Words, `done` — or marked
 * `failed`. One Clip that fails never fails the rest, and never fails the
 * whole run.
 *
 * Run by `POST /clips/transcribe` today and by the `transcribe-clips` Job
 * kind (`sidecar/kinds/transcribe-clips.ts`); batch 7 moves the route's
 * callers onto the Job. `onClipSettled` hears each Clip as it lands, in the
 * order they land.
