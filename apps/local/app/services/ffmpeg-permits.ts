 * How many heavy ffmpeg encodes the whole process runs at once — every pass
 * through `runFfmpegWithProgress` (a Video's concat, its audio normalize, its
 * Definition Card composite) and a Short's subtitle burn-in.
 *
 * Two, from the evidence. Publish Job 859b8689 ran six 100-input concats at
 * once (`MAX_CONCURRENT_EXPORTS` 6, under what was then 6 GPU permits) on a
 * machine with 47 GiB of RAM; with NVENC gone they ran on libx264, the box
 * ran out of memory, and ffmpeg, the database connection and the sidecar's
 * lease all went with it. One 101-input concat (a real 11-minute Video,
 * measured with `/usr/bin/time -v` on 2026-10-09) peaks at 9.9 GiB RSS on
 * h264_nvenc and 10.4 GiB on the libx264 fallback: every input keeps its own
 * demuxer, decoder and filter queue open for the whole pass. Six want 62 GiB;
 * two want 21 GiB, leaving the rest for Postgres, the dev server, OBS and the
 * desktop. Three (31 GiB) would leave too little once anything else is busy.

 * - **CPU permits** (`FFMPEG_CPU_PERMITS`, default 12): the quick,

 *

 * course runs one ffmpeg at a time.
