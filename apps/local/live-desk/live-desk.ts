/**
 * Matt's live desk: his real OBS and the Stream Deck forwarder hub his button
 * presses go through. Only the MAIN CHECKOUT of the repo may touch it.
 *
 * Every other checkout — an agent's worktree, a verify-cvm run — is pointed at
 * the discard port, where nothing answers. A worktree's editor on the live hub
 * would act on Matt's real presses (delete-last-clip and the rest) and could
 * send to his editor; a worktree's forwarder would take the hub's ports when
 * his stack is down. So the desk FAILS CLOSED: a checkout is live only when it
 * can prove it is the main one, and anything that cannot answer (no git, a
 * tarball, an error) is treated as a worktree.
 *
 * No setup: Matt's main checkout is detected, not declared.
