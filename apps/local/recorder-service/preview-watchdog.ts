/**
 * THE PREVIEW WATCHDOG (#2192). A preview ffmpeg.exe can stall while still
 * running (a Short's screen preview stopped sending at 75 s and only a
 * restart of `pnpm dev` brought it back), and the browser kept showing its
 * last frame. So each preview-only process is watched: no frame for
 * `PREVIEW_STALL_MS` (a longer wait for its first) and it is stalled, and
 * its owner restarts it. Its stderr goes into the service's log (a preview
 * logs warnings and errors only), a few lines a minute at most.
 *
 * Only preview-only processes are watched. The camera preview a recording
 * carries is never restarted: the recording's own watch (camera-lost) is
 * what answers for that process.
