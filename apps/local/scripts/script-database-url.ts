/**
 * The connection string for a one-off DB script under `apps/local/scripts/`.
 *
 * Every such script needs the same three things, so get them here rather than
 * re-deriving them per script:
 *
 * 1. **The env.** Load the repo-root `.env` exactly as
 *    `packages/core/drizzle.config.ts` does (`process.loadEnvFile`), so a
 *    script runs from a plain checkout the same way `pnpm db:migrate` does.
 *    A missing file is fine — a real environment supplies the variables — and
 *    `loadEnvFile` never overrides a variable already set, so
 *    `DATABASE_URL=… pnpm --filter @cvm/local db:…` still points a run at a
 *    local clone.
 * 2. **The URL.** Pooled by default; `direct: true` for anything touching
 *    schema or migration bookkeeping (see `@cvm/core/db/database-url`).
 * 3. **The target, announced.** Prints the host — never the credentials — so
 *    the operator sees which database is about to be read or written.
 * 4. **The target, guarded.** From a git worktree, a writable connection to a
 *    remote database is refused before it is opened — see
 *    `@cvm/core/db/connection-guard`.
 *
 * Build the client here too — `scriptPgClient()` or `scriptDrizzle()` — never
 * with `new Client`/`new Pool` in the script: scripts/check-db-clients.sh
 * allows client construction only in the guarded factories.
