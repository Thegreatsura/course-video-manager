/**
 * One-off: rewrite every absolute path under a Storage Root to its
 * root-relative form (#2104). Matt runs it, from main, against production.
 *
 *   pnpm storage:migrate-paths            # dry run: report only, writes nothing
 *   pnpm storage:migrate-paths --apply    # rewrite, in one transaction
 *
 * --apply refuses while this checkout's app (port 5173) or Sidecar is
 * running: stop `pnpm dev` first. Safe in either order with `storage:rename-exports`, and safe to run twice:
 * a relative path is never touched again. Paths under no root (Recording
 * Sessions in ~/Videos) are reported and left as they are. It writes around
 * the Draft guard on purpose — see packages/core/services/storage-path-migration.server.ts.
