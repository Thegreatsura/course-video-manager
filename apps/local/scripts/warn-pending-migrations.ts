/**
 * Runs before `pnpm dev` / `pnpm start`: warns, loudly, when the database
 * apps/local talks to has not applied every migration in this checkout.
 *
 * Day to day that database is production (PlanetScale), and migrations are
 * applied by hand (ADR 0026). So after a `git pull` that brings in a migration,
 * this checkout's code can select a column production does not have yet until
 * Matt runs `pnpm db:migrate` — and the failure shows up as a broken page, not
 * as a reason. This names the reason before the server starts.
 *
 * READ-ONLY: one SELECT on Drizzle's bookkeeping table. It never migrates, and
 * it never blocks startup — an unreachable database or a missing table is a
 * note, not an exit code, so the server still comes up and reports its own
 * errors.
