/**
 * How many times each kind of job runs before it fails, and which lane it
 * runs in — COPIED from the Upload Manager, per Matt's decision
 * (docs/plans/background-jobs-sidecar.md, section 6). The sidecar adds no
 * policy of its own.
 *
 * Copied from the browser Upload Manager (deleted in batch 8), as found on
 * 2026-10-08 (section 7.1 of the plan):
 *
 * - A job's failure counted an attempt; while fewer than 3 had run and the
 *   entry was not `terminal`, it went to `retrying` and the browser re-ran it
 *   AT ONCE with the params it started with. No delay, no backoff, and every
 *   error was retryable. So: 3 attempts.
 * - A Publish and an Autofill reported every failure as fatal, which set
 *   `terminal` — and so did the per-Video rows each fans out into.
 *   So: 1 attempt.
 * - EXCEPT posting (YouTube, Shorts, Buffer, AI Hero, Skills Changelog):
 *   Matt's decision 5 gives each exactly 1 attempt and no re-queue — see
 *   `PostingJobPolicy` below.
 * - A dropped stream is a failure like any other: the reader rejects, the
 *   client calls `onError`, and the job spends an attempt. The sidecar treats
 *   a run it LOST — its lease ran out (`recoverExpiredJobs`), or it lost the
 *   lease mid-run — the same way: retried while attempts remain,
 *   `interrupted` on the last. A deliberate stop (a signal) is not a lost
 *   run: it puts the Job back at the same attempt (`returnJobToQueue`).
 * - When a job fails for good, every job waiting on it fails with
 *   `Dependency "<title>" failed`. The sidecar does the same, in the same
 *   transaction (`failDependents`), and fails a Job enqueued behind one that
 *   had already failed.
 *
 * The narrow retries INSIDE a service stay inside it, untouched: an export
 * inside a Publish or batch `recurs(2)` (`course-publish-export-events.ts:160`),
 * the Dropbox commit `recurs(1)` (`commitPhase` in `CoursePublishService`), Dropbox HTTP
 * `recurs(5)` on a 429/5xx (`dropbox-http-client.ts:36-39`), an AI Hero part 5
 * (`ai-hero-upload-service.ts:12`), Autofill's `recurs(3)` per Video
 * (`autofill-service.ts:57-62`).
