/**
 * The sidecar's entry point (`pnpm dev` runs it as `dev:sidecar`, `pnpm start`
 * as `start:sidecar`), and its one Effect runtime boundary.
 *
 * EVERY EXIT IS 0. `pnpm dev` runs the app, the forwarder and this side by
 * side, and pnpm stops all of them when one fails — so a sidecar that must
 * not run here (a worktree pointed at production, a read-only connection,
 * a service URL override that would send a token elsewhere, another sidecar
 * holding the lease) says why, loudly, and gets out of the app's way.
 *
 * IT RESTARTS ITSELF. A run that ends any other way — a database outage that
 * lapsed its lease, a database it could not reach, a crash — runs again after
 * a wait that doubles up to 30 s (`superviseSidecar`), so Jobs never
 * stall behind a sidecar nobody restarted. Only a signal ends it. While it
 * is down the app says so on every page (`SidecarDownBanner`), and nothing
 * is lost: an enqueued Job is a row, and waits.
