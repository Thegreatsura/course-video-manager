/**
 * THE SIDECAR: the one process that runs background Jobs for a database.
 *
 * It holds the database's single `sidecar_lease`, claims Jobs lane by lane,
 * runs each Job's handler in its own fiber, heartbeats every running Job's
 * lease, and settles each attempt by the retry rule in `db-job-operations`. A
 * Job whose sidecar died is settled the same way by the next recovery sweep.
 *
 * NO FAILURE LEAVES WITHOUT A LOG LINE. Every handler's exit — success,
 * failure, defect or interruption — goes through `settle`, which logs it
 * (with the whole cause) before it touches the row, and every loop logs its
 * own failures and carries on. A handler never has to remember to log.
