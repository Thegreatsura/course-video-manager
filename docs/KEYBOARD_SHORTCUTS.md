# Keyboard shortcuts

The detail behind "The Animatic page answers the Video page's keys" in
[`CODING_STANDARDS.md`](../CODING_STANDARDS.md).

The author walks an Animatic with the same habit he walks a filmed Video with,
so the two screens must not disagree about a key. Every shortcut the Video page
has (`features/video-editor/hooks/use-keyboard-shortcuts.ts`) is **ported to the
Animatic page where it has a meaning there**, and it keeps the same meaning:
SPACE plays and pauses where the playhead is, RETURN plays the selected item
from its start, the arrows move the selection and do not touch playback, HOME and
END go to the ends, L and K are 2x and 1x.

One pair differs ON PURPOSE: ARROW LEFT and ARROW RIGHT. On the Video page they
are a second UP and DOWN; on the Animatic they step the PLAYHEAD to the previous
or next Clip Mockup, folded or not, because the author is watching the picture
and a selection does not move it. UP and DOWN keep the Video page's meaning.

Port a key only if the Animatic has something for it to act on — the Animatic is
read-only, so DELETE, ALT+ARROW (reorder) and B (pause marker) have no
equivalent and are left out. When a shortcut is ADDED to the Video page, decide
at that moment whether it makes sense on the Animatic page, and add it there too
or say in the code why it cannot be. The two screens also hold the same shape:
the list of moments on the left, the picture on the right.

Both pages share one guard for when a key is not the page's to take —
`app/hooks/should-ignore-keyboard-shortcut.ts`. A new keyboard surface uses it
rather than writing its own test for inputs, Monaco and dialogs.

A surface that lives INSIDE a dialog — the Article Writer preview, whose L and K
step through its ChooseScreenshot placeholders — cannot use that guard whole, so
it uses the guard's `isTypingTarget` half and scopes itself to keys from its own
dialog. The Video and Animatic pages refuse every key from a dialog, so the two
L/K meanings never both act on one press.
