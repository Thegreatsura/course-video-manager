# Landing a change

`main` is protected by a ruleset: a PR merges only once the `check` status is green on a branch that is up to date with `main` (strict). Every change lands through this sequence.

1. **Worktree.** `git fetch origin && git worktree add .claude/worktrees/<name> -b <branch> origin/main`, then `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --prefer-offline` inside it. A worktree never opens a writable connection to a remote database: `DrizzleService`, the `db:*` scripts and drizzle-kit refuse (`packages/core/db/connection-guard.ts`), and `cvm`'s local-only commands refuse too.
2. **Commit.** `pnpm run check` is green before you push. Every commit ends with the trailer `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
3. **Browser check.** Any change with a visible effect in the UI is driven in the browser with `verify-cvm` (`.claude/skills/verify-cvm/SKILL.md` — read it directly if the skill isn't loaded) before you open the PR. It runs on a clone of its own and needs no `.env`. Copy the evidence directory out of `.verify/` before the worktree goes.
4. **PR.** `gh pr create`; the body states what you clicked and saw in the browser, with screenshots or the evidence path, or says `No UI change`; the body ends with `🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)`.
5. **Merge.** Done when the PR shows `MERGED` and your worktree is gone:
   1. Wait for `check` to pass (`gh pr checks <pr> --watch`).
   2. If `gh pr view <pr> --json mergeStateStatus` says `BEHIND`, run `gh pr update-branch <pr>` and go back to 5.1.
   3. `gh pr merge <pr> --merge`. Leave off `--delete-branch`: `main` is checked out in another worktree, so the local cleanup fails.
   4. `git push origin --delete <branch>`, then `git worktree remove .claude/worktrees/<name>`.

**Waiting and polling.** Prefer `gh pr checks <pr> --watch` to a hand-rolled loop. Any wait or poll loop you do write gets a timeout (`timeout 900 bash -c 'until …; do sleep 5; done'`) and writes its logs inside your own worktree, never shared `/tmp`: a loop waiting on a file that never appears there runs for hours after you finish. Before you finish, stop every background command you started.

The ruleset is the only gate, and it holds for agents without exception: merge through the loop above, every time. `--admin`, ruleset bypass and direct pushes to `main` are reserved for the human admin.

Never skip hooks: no `git commit --no-verify`, no `HUSKY=0`, no other way round them. If a hook fails because of something on `main`, merge `main` or wait for the PR that fixes it; never bypass the hook.

## A PR with a migration

Follow the `deploy-migration` skill (`.claude/skills/deploy-migration/SKILL.md`): the migration and its code may ship in one PR, the `apps/remote` deploy fails on purpose until Matt migrates production, then you redeploy. Agents never run `db:migrate` against production (ADR 0026).
