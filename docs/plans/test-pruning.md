# Test pruning

Matt's goal: fewer tests, each one earning its place. The bar is the
"What earns a test its place" rule in [`TESTING_STANDARDS.md`](../TESTING_STANDARDS.md#what-earns-a-test-its-place):
a test must be able to fail for a plausible real bug in behavior a user or
caller observes.

This file classifies every test file in the repo (audit of 2026-10-06, 371
files, ~4,850 test cases) as **keep / trim / delete / consolidate**, with a
one-line reason, a confidence, its test count and its local runtime. Trims name
the exact test titles to remove, under each area's "Trim details".

## How to take a batch

1. Pick one batch below. Batches touch disjoint files, so several agents can
   run at once.
2. In each file, act on the rows and the named tests only. Re-read every test
   before you remove it: if it is the last guard on a real rule (grep for other
   tests of the same function), keep it or fold its assertion into a survivor.
   If unsure, keep.
3. Run the touched files, then land the batch through `docs/agents/merging.md`
   with the deleted tests listed in the PR body, grouped by reason.
4. Mark the rows `done (batch N)` here in the same PR.

Never touch `entity-menus.test.ts` or `features/entity-links/` under this plan.
They are guard tests owned elsewhere.

## Batches

**Next batch: 5** (`features/video-editor/`, `features/article-writer/`). Batches 1 to 4 are done;
take the lowest-numbered batch whose row does not say **Done.**

**Batch 1: done.** It removed the high-confidence deletes and trims across
all areas: 9 files deleted, about 50 trimmed. Rows marked `done (batch 1)`
had their high-confidence items removed. Trims tagged "(medium)" inside those
files remain for the area's batch below.

| Batch | Scope                                                                                                  | What is left                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

**Batch 2: done.** It trimmed the CLI files (737 → 670 tests) and cut the
per-test setup cost every PGlite test pays:

- `truncateAllTables` issues one `TRUNCATE` naming every table instead of one
  per table. That was ~90ms per call, most of a typical DB test; it is now
  ~15ms. It helps every PGlite-backed test in the repo, not just the CLI.
- `createUnreachableDb()` replaces "create a PGlite, then close it" in the
  database-failure tests. `close()` alone took about a second.
- `cli-search` and `cli-integration` seed once per describe where no test
  writes (`beforeAll(reseed)`), and per test only where one does.

Where the plan's trim was the last guard on a rule, batch 2 kept it or folded
its assertion into a survivor instead: chapter append order, the
clip-mockup-chapter `get` success path, deliverable re-archive, lesson rename
keeping its authoring status, the per-noun `withName` and archived-scope-root
checks (each now one test over all nouns), and the clip-mockup and footage
local-only resource names.

**Batch 3: done** (PRs #1829, #1830, #1831; split in three because it
deleted ~3,800 lines). It pruned `packages/core/`: 670 → 530 tests in
`@cvm/core`, 64 → 58 files; local `vitest run` for the package went from
11.3s to 9.1s wall (34.3s → 29.7s summed per-file time).

- The five `course-write-*` files are one `course-write-e2e.test.ts` (24 → 13).
- `db-version-copy` has a `COPY_SPEC` drift guard like
  `db-duplicate-course-drift`, so a new column on a copied table fails until
  it is classified. The two `*.clip-mockup-chapters` files are folded into
  their parents.
- Writing that guard showed `copyVersionStructure` does not carry
  `videos.format`, `clips.zoomType` or `clips.diagramSnapshotId` (the guard
  lists them as `notCopied` with a comment). That looks like a real bug and
  needs its own issue.

Plan trims kept or folded because they were the last guard on a rule:
`getCourseStructureById` returning `memory` (kept; the column list is
explicit and video-posting-context reads it), copyVideo "does not rename the
source when renameOld is false" (kept; renaming the source is destructive),
clip-zoom "allows every camera scene" (kept; the only positive eligibility
check), and folded into survivors: a known zoom level resolving, transcript
`indexedClips` source metadata, `flattenRichText` on a content-less doc,
section paths with a double-digit number and multi-word slug, archived
diagrams hidden by default, `getDiagram`'s success path, snapshots
unpreserved by default, and pitches with no videos still listed.

**Batch 4: done** (PRs #1876, #1877 and the PR that marked this; split in
three by file family). It pruned `apps/local/app/services/`: 705 → 639 tests
across the area's 76 files, and `@cvm/local` 3,872 → 3,806.

- The seven `clip-service-*` files share one harness,
  `clip-service-test-setup.ts`.
- `course-publish-service.test.ts` and `-batch-export` run on
  `setupPublishableCourse`; `course-publish-dropbox-sync` runs on
  `setupUploads`. The bundle readers (`remoteBundleVideoPaths`,
  `receiptManifest`) are bound to each setup's own fake Dropbox through
  `bundleReaders`, so the publish files import them instead of redefining
  them.
- The optional fold of `export-hash-overlay-animation` and
  `export-hash-camera-version` back into `export-hash.test.ts` was not taken.

Plan trims kept or folded because they were the last guard on a rule:
ClipService "updates pause type for a single clip" and "updates the name of a
chapter" (kept; the only tests of the `update-pause` and `update-chapter`
events, which `updateClips` does not go through), overlay-content-renderer
"carries both Animation Toggles" (kept; the renderer schema defaults both to
false, so a dropped toggle passes every other test), and folded into
survivors: an effect clip is created already transcribed, a Buffer post's
`remoteUrl` starts null, plain `http://` images are skipped by the Cloudinary
upload, and a re-export's SHA256 replaces the previous Bundle's in the
manifest (the cited dropbox-upload test clears the remote first, so never
sees a copied-forward digest).

### Coverage gaps batch 1 exposed

Batch 1 removed tests that exercised a copy of the logic written inside the
test file, so these never had real coverage. If they matter, extract a pure
function and test it there:

- The lesson title save guard (`lesson-title-editor`).
- The upload manager's retry effect (`upload-manager-integration`).
- The audio boost Strict Mode fix (fcdc392c, `use-audio-boost`). One
  `renderHook` test that mounts twice would guard it.

## Slowest files

Local runtimes, measured one package at a time. `@cvm/local` is about 75% of
all tests and runs in four CI shards of about 1m40s each.

#### .sandcastle/review/parse-diff-lines.test.ts

- "returns empty map for whitespace-only diff" — same rule as "returns empty map for empty diff"

#### .sandcastle/run-with-extraction.test.ts

- "describes a missing tag distinctly from a validation failure" — retry-prompt wording is runWithRetry's; covered in run-with-retry.test.ts
- "rethrows the final StructuredOutputError after exhausting attempts" — runWithRetry's contract, already tested there
- "honours a custom maxAttempts" — runWithRetry's contract (pass-through here)
- "does not retry on a non-StructuredOutputError" — runWithRetry's contract, already tested there

#### apps/local/stream-deck-forwarder/connection-log.test.ts

- "prints each origin on its first connect" — covered by the first-connect test and "collapsing one origin does not silence another"

#### packages/core/db/database-url.test.ts

- "is the pooled connection string" — one-line pass-through of env.DATABASE_URL
- "is undefined when DATABASE_URL is unset" — same pass-through
- "is undefined when neither is set" — trivial `||` fallthrough

#### packages/core/db/migrations.test.ts

- "applies the baseline migration on a fresh database" — subsumed by "migrate produces the same public-schema tables as pushSchema"
- "is a no-op when the baseline is already registered" — tests drizzle's migrator idempotency (third-party); also a slow PGlite boot

#### packages/core/db/schema-feature-probes.test.ts

- "covers every feature the hosted database is at risk of not supporting" — restates the SCHEMA_FEATURE_PROBES name list

#### packages/core/features/videos/clip-zoom.test.ts

- "passes through every known level" — iterates CLIP_ZOOM_TYPES against itself
- "pins the subtle shot: 115%, centred in x, biased above centre in y" — restates the constant; behaviour is covered by "crops toward the top of frame" and the agreement tests
- "allows every camera scene" — iterates ZOOMABLE_SCENES against the function that reads it

#### packages/core/features/videos/overlay-transform.test.ts

- "agree at t=${moment}s" (loop, 6 generated tests) — strictly subsumed by "agree at EVERY moment of the move, not only at the ends" (2000-step sweep)
- "states every end of every move as an offset alone" — checks the table's own key shape; "never puts a scale in the preview's CSS" and "hands the export back a frame of the source's own size" cover the behaviour

#### packages/core/features/videos/retime-cascade.test.ts

- "drops a word pushed off the front of the Clip" — "shifts every word by the delta, keeping its text" already shows "the" dropped with the same input
- "leaves a word untouched when nothing about the cut moved" — zero-delta identity; low value
- "does not mutate the words it was given" — implementation detail
- "is idempotent — clamping an already-clamped anchor does nothing" — follows trivially from clamping; the clamp-bound tests cover it

- "handles a scene with an empty store" — duplicates "never throws on completely invalid input" ({} case)
- "handles mixed shapes — extractable and non-extractable" — combination of "joins multiple shapes" and the exclusion tests

#### packages/core/lib/scene-hash.test.ts

- "produces different output for semantically different scenes" — JSON.stringify inevitably differs; no rule
- "includes schema field in output — different schema versions produce different results" — same
- "produces different hashes for semantically different scenes" — hashScene = sha256(canonicalize); duplicates the canonicalize test
- "produces different hashes when schema version differs (contract)" — duplicate across the seam
- "returns a 64-character hex string (SHA-256)" — tests node:crypto output format

#### packages/core/lib/transcript-builder.test.ts

- "synchronizes indexedClips indices with transcript markers" — duplicates "includes clips with null text in indexedClips but skips in transcript"
- "per-section word counts sum to total wordCount minus markdown overhead" — duplicates the word-count asserts in "correctly interleaves clips and sections"
- "handles clips before the first section with multiple sections" — same rule as "handles clips before the first section correctly"

- "returns raw lucide primitives, not transpiled geometry" — subsumed by "uses only the seven lucide primitives across the whole set" plus generator.test's key-stripping test

### Consolidate details

#### course-write-*.test.ts → packages/core/services/course-write-e2e.test.ts (or rename it course-write-service.test.ts)

All five files copy the same ~100-line `setup()` (PGlite + layers + createSection/createLesson/getLesson helpers). Merge into one file with one setup, and drop these while merging:

- course-write-e2e: "full flow produces correct DB rows" (addLesson + a pass-through updateLesson; covered by "creates with authoringStatus todo"), "archives a section regardless of its lessons" (pass-through to lsOps.archiveSection), "is false on a freshly created Draft Version" (first assert of the "flips true" test), "creates a lesson with correct DB state" (duplicates lesson-ops "creates a lesson with correct slug")
- course-write-lesson-ops: "archives a lesson in the database" (subsumed by "archives one lesson without affecting siblings")
- course-write-reorder: "updates order values for all-lessons" (same as "reverses lesson order values"), "normalizes a single lesson order to zero" (sets 0 to 0; nothing normalises), "inserts before the first lesson and shifts others" (same rule as lesson-ops "inserts before an existing lesson when position is specified")
- course-write-move: "moves the only lesson from a section", "handles moving all lessons from a section" (weaker variants of the main move tests)
- course-write-section-ops: "is a no-op when the order has not changed"
  Result: 24 → 13 tests, 5 files → 1.

#### packages/core/services/db-duplicate-course.clip-mockup-chapters.test.ts → packages/core/services/db-duplicate-course.test.ts

One test whose fixture is a richer createFullCourseStructure. Add the interleaved chapter to that fixture and assert it alongside "copies clip mockups in order and excludes archived ones".

#### packages/core/services/db-version-copy.clip-mockup-chapters.test.ts → packages/core/services/db-version-copy.test.ts

Same as above, for copyVersionStructure.

#### packages/core/services/db-version-copy.test.ts (internal)

- Replace "preserves lesson icon (type) when copying a version", "preserves section description when copying a version", "preserves lesson authoringStatus when copying a version", "copies a video's beats, preserving kind/title/order", "copies a video's clip mockups, preserving line/imagePath/order" with one COPY_SPEC drift test (copy db-duplicate-course-drift.test.ts's pattern). That catches every future column, not just these five.
- Merge "skips archived sections when copying a version", "skips archived lessons when copying a version", "excludes archived beats when copying a video", "excludes archived clip mockups when copying a video" into one "copies only active rows at every level" test.
- Keep "serializes concurrent clones from the same latest Course Version" and "does not load clip mockups".
- Also fold db-video-body-description's "copies body and description forward on version clone" into the drift test.
  Result: ~11 (+1 merged file) → ~4.

### Trim details

#### apps/local/app/services/beat-learning-goal-warnings.test.ts

- "is false for a section with no learning goals": sectionHasLearningGoals is `learningGoals.length > 0`; the test mirrors it
- "is true once a section has at least one learning goal": same

#### apps/local/app/services/buffer-posting-orchestration.server.test.ts

- "creates row before upload and sets remoteId after createPost": the happy-path test already asserts the row's remoteId/postedAt; this only swaps the id literal

#### apps/local/app/services/clip-mockup-copy-forward.test.ts

- "gives the duplicate a fresh lineageId — the reason the files must move": asserts a precondition of duplicateVideo, not the copy-forward behaviour

#### apps/local/app/services/clip-mockup-speech-service.test.ts

- "agrees with itself: byte rate is block align times sample rate": "writes a format chunk a decoder will accept" already pins every header field explicitly
- "is the same file for the same words": determinism check on a hash function; low value (medium)

#### apps/local/app/services/clip-service-effect-clips.test.ts

- "creates an effect clip after a clip": subsumed by "inserts effect clip between two existing clips with correct ordering"
- "creates an effect clip with correct field values": re-states effectClipDefaults back (medium)

#### apps/local/app/services/clip-service-sections.test.ts

- "moves a section up past an adjacent section (no clips between)": the second step of "preserves ordering when moving a section up past another section" does exactly this
- "updates the name of a chapter": single-column setter pass-through

#### apps/local/app/services/clip-service-selection-move.test.ts

- "move mode creates a new video AND archives originals from source": subsumed by "move mode with mixed selection archives all selected originals"
- "move mode archives original chapters from source": same

#### apps/local/app/services/clip-service-selection.test.ts

- "selecting a single clip creates a valid new video": a weaker copy of "copy mode creates a new video with selected clips, originals remain in source"
- "mixed selection creates a new video with all selected items": "items in new video preserve their relative order from source timeline" is a mixed selection with stronger asserts
- "selecting all items creates a new video with everything": same rule as the two above with a different literal (medium)

#### apps/local/app/services/clip-service-timeline.test.ts

- "creates a standalone video": echoes the input title and lessonId null (medium)
- "returns clips sorted by order": subsumed by "returns clips and sections interleaved and sorted" (medium)
- "archives a single clip": subsumed by "archives multiple clips"
- "updates pause type for a single clip": single-column setter; pauseType is already covered by "updates scene, profile, and pauseType for a clip" (medium)

#### apps/local/app/services/cloudinary-markdown-service.test.ts

- "preserves alt text": "handles mixed local and http images" asserts full bodies with alt text
- "processes multiple images": the mixed test uploads two images and checks both
- "resolves relative paths from base directory": asserts a mocked existsSync call (implementation detail); the mixed test's uploadedFilePaths already pins path.resolve(base, rel)
- "skips http URLs": the mixed test covers http skip (medium)

#### apps/local/app/services/course-editor-service-beats.test.ts

- "clears the description back to empty": the same setter called with "" (medium)

#### apps/local/app/services/course-editor-service-lessons.test.ts

- "returns early when slug is unchanged": asserts the same result shape as a rename and nothing about returning early
- "creates a real lesson even when the course has no filePath": only asserts success:true; "creates a real lesson in a section with a parseable path" covers creation (medium)
- "real lesson starts with authoringStatus 'todo'": "marks a todo lesson as done" already asserts a createLesson lesson starts todo
- "updates the description": single-column setter pass-through (medium)
- "updates the icon": single-column setter pass-through (medium)
- "updates the priority": single-column setter pass-through (medium)
- "updates dependencies array": single-column setter pass-through (medium)
- "soft-deletes a real lesson without renumbering siblings": never asserts the siblings' order, so it is a copy of "soft-deletes a lesson (sets archived, not removed from DB)"
- "reorders real lessons by updating order values only": same assert as "reorders lessons by updating order field"
- "moves a real lesson to an empty section and updates paths via planner": never asserts a path, so it is a copy of "moves a lesson to another section"
- "set-lesson-authoring-status round-trips between done and todo": the union of "marks a todo lesson as done" and "marks a done lesson back to todo"

#### apps/local/app/services/course-editor-service-sections.test.ts

- "renames a section by storing the new title verbatim" (the SECOND one, line ~150): a literal duplicate title and rule; it only varies how the section was created
- "returns early when the new title matches the current title": asserts nothing about returning early
- "archives a section even when it has real lessons": subsumed by "archives a section and lessons are preserved (not deleted)"
- "archives a section with lessons": same
- "reorders real sections by updating order values only": same rule and assert as "reorders sections by updating order field"

#### apps/local/app/services/course-publish-dropbox-placeholder.test.ts

- "re-addresses the bundle when the floor moves": course-publish-bundle-address "re-addresses the bundle when the Placeholder Floor moves" pins the rule at the pure seam

#### apps/local/app/services/course-publish-dropbox-sync.test.ts

- "uploads video files to Dropbox": subsumed by "uploads videos for all lessons"
- "verifies existing bundle integrity via content_hash + size": same as dropbox-upload "uploads zero Videos when re-publishing an unchanged Course Version"
- "emits per-lesson progress events": weaker copy of dropbox-upload "reports monotonic progress with several uploads in flight"
- "course.json uses lineageId as correlation id": only asserts `id` is defined and non-empty; never checks it is the lineageId (medium)
- "course.json includes the render-input hash and exported byte receipt": covered by dropbox-upload "keeps every Video's SHA256 and byte count in the shipped manifest" (medium)

#### apps/local/app/services/course-publish-dropbox-upload.test.ts

- "still fails when a Video in the bundle does not match its expected bytes": dropbox-sync "rejects bundle corruption without moving the commit marker" is the same scenario and also checks the receipt is untouched (medium)

#### apps/local/app/services/course-publish-service-overlay-composite.test.ts

- "counts a long Pause on a preceding Clip": overlay-compositing "counts a preceding Clip's long Pause as part of the timeline" is the right seam
- "gives a Definition Card and a Bullet Panel of the same title different renders": overlay-render-cache "never collides with a Definition Card of the same title and duration"
- "re-exports to a new address when a bullet's icon is edited" (edit-case row): keep one representative row ("a bullet's text"); field sensitivity is pinned in overlay-render-cache (medium)
- "re-exports to a new address when a bullet's revealAt is edited" (edit-case row): same (medium)
- "re-exports to a new address when the panel's heading is edited" (edit-case row): same (medium)
- "re-exports to a new address when an Animation Toggle is set": pinned by export-hash-overlay-animation and overlay-render-cache "each Animation Toggle changes the hash" (medium)
- "addresses each render by its content, under the Course": same wiring as "asks the cache for the panel's own content, bullets and all" (medium)

#### apps/local/app/services/course-publish-service-publish.test.ts

- "fails with PublishValidationError when export fails after retries": strict subset of "emits a per-video error event and still fails with PublishValidationError" (same setup, same asserts plus more)

#### apps/local/app/services/course-publish-service-reexport.test.ts

- "records the re-exported file's SHA256 in the manifest": dropbox-upload "re-derives the manifest's SHA256 from the bytes that actually shipped" pins the same rule one seam down (medium)

#### apps/local/app/services/course-publish-service-short-export.test.ts

- "accepts an export longer than its Clips ask for": export-duration-check has the identical case at the pure seam
- "refuses a zero-length export": export-duration-check "refuses a zero-length export, however little was expected"; wiring is proven by "fails the Publish and names the Video whose export was short"

#### apps/local/app/services/course-publish-service-video-tasks.test.ts

- "emits per-Video upload events even when nothing needs exporting": covered by "names every shipping Video in the upload roster, exported or not" and "queues an already-exported Video for upload without waiting on any encode" (medium)

#### apps/local/app/services/course-publish-service.test.ts

- "accepts a video object and returns false when no file exists": overload near-duplicate of the id variant (medium)
- "accepts a video object and returns true when file exists": same (medium)
- "accepts a video object and returns content-addressed path": same (medium)
- "isExported returns true after exportVideo": just chains "exports video to content-addressed path" and the isExported tests
- "validatePublishability passes after all videos exported": the same as "returns empty list when all videos are exported" plus "returns unexported video IDs..."
- "returns courseViewLintCount including lesson warnings for invalid video-role combos": 80 lines of hand-rolled re-setup to re-test a lesson-warnings rule; the wiring is proven by "returns courseViewLintCount > 0 when missingChapters warning exists" (medium)

#### apps/local/app/services/dropbox-upload-config.test.ts

- "defaults upload concurrency to 4": restates a constant; dropbox-upload "uploads several Videos at once, up to the default limit of 4" covers it in behaviour
- "reads upload concurrency from DROPBOX_UPLOAD_CONCURRENCY": Effect Config behaviour; dropbox-upload "never exceeds the configured concurrency limit" covers it end to end (medium)
- "defaults the upload chunk size to 16 MB": restates a constant (medium)

#### apps/local/app/services/export-duration-check.test.ts

- "accepts an export short by less than the tolerance": the boundary is pinned by "short by exactly the tolerance" and "short by more than the tolerance" (medium)

#### apps/local/app/services/export-hash-camera-version.test.ts

- "keeps the two Kinds at different addresses": export-hash "changing an Overlay's kind changes the address"

#### apps/local/app/services/export-hash-overlay-animation.test.ts

- "leave the address alone when neither is set": card() already defaults both to false, so it compares identical inputs

#### apps/local/app/services/export-hash.test.ts

- "transcript text changes do not affect the hash": both inputs are identical (no text field at all); pure tautology
- "changing EXPORT_VERSION would change hashes": asserts `hash` is truthy and `EXPORT_VERSION === 1`
- "leaves the address of a clip with no Overlays untouched": the same input and same pinned literal as "leaves the address of a clip without a long pause untouched"; one pin is enough
- "is deterministic for the same input": determinism of sha256; the pinned-literal test already proves stability (medium)
- "returns a 32-char hex string for clips": the pinned literal already proves the format (medium)
- "returns {courseId}-{hash}.mp4": string concatenation mirrored (medium)
- "returns absolute path in finished videos directory": path.join mirrored (medium)

#### apps/local/app/services/ffmpeg-log-capture.test.ts

- "defaults to MAX_STDERR_TAIL_CHARS when no limit is given": restates the constant (medium)

#### apps/local/app/services/lesson-warnings.test.ts

- "returns solution for 'Solution 2'": same rule as "returns explainer for 'Explainer 2'" (medium)
- "does not flag the bare role name 'Explainer'": the same input and assert as "returns no warnings for {explainer}"
- "flags 'Explainer 1' as a numbered role name (canonical is 'Explainer')": near-duplicate of "flags 'Explainer 2' alone..."; Explainer 1 is also in the combo test (medium)
- "returns 0 for empty sections": computeCourseViewLintCount is `collectCourseViewLints(...).length` (medium)
- "returns 0 for a valid explainer lesson with chapters": same (medium)
- "counts lesson warnings for invalid role combos": re-tests collect via .length; "tags a lesson-level lint..." covers it
- "counts video warnings for missing chapters": re-tests collect; "tags a video-level lint..." covers it
- "sums warnings across multiple lessons and videos": "count is exactly the number of itemised lints" uses the same fixture

#### apps/local/app/services/overlay-content-renderer.test.ts

- "renders at the landscape export frame" (Bullet Panels describe): duplicate of the Definition Cards one; both restate OVERLAY_RENDER_FRAME
- "carries the card's own words": one-line field mapping (medium)
- "carries both Animation Toggles": one-line field mapping (medium)

#### apps/local/app/services/overlay-render-cache.test.ts

- "returns a 32-char hex string" (Bullet Panels describe): the format is identical to cards and pinned by the legacy-hash test
- "returns a 32-char hex string" (Definition Cards describe): pinned by "keeps the address every card cached before Bullet Panels existed had" (medium)
- "is stable for the same content" (Definition Cards describe): determinism of a hash (medium)
- "is stable for the same content" (Bullet Panels describe): same (medium)
- "hashes at the current Overlay Renderer Version": computeOverlayContentHash is atVersion(current); a tautology
- "bumping the Overlay Renderer Version changes the hash" (Bullet Panels describe): duplicate of the card one; the version is not kind-specific
- "names the file {courseId}-{contentHash}.mov": string concatenation mirrored
- "puts the render in the cache directory": path.join mirrored (medium)
- "gives identical content under the same course one path": determinism (medium)
- "gives a Bullet Panel a path of the same shape": path.join mirrored (medium)

#### apps/local/app/services/route-action.server.test.ts

- "runs an action whose effect needs no services on an empty runtime": byte-identical body to makeAction "returns success value when effect succeeds"
- makeLoader "passes params to the effect": pass-through, same as makeAction's (medium)
- makeLoader "maps ParseError to 400 by default": same buildErrorPipeline; only the map literal differs (medium)
- makeLoader "maps custom error tags to configured status codes": shared buildErrorPipeline, already tested via makeAction
- makeLoader "maps an error tag with no configured status to 500": same
- makeLoader "propagates Effect.die from inside the effect as-is": same
- makeLoader "custom errors extend rather than replace default mappings": same as makeAction "custom errors extend rather than replace the default map"
- makeLoader "logs error cause via Console.dir on error": same pipeline; console spy

#### apps/local/app/services/silence-detection.test.ts

- "does not adjust timestamps when startTime is 0": same expected output as "returns clips without offset when startTime is not provided" (medium)

#### apps/local/app/services/video-files.test.ts

- "returns URL as-is when filename is an http URL": duplicate of the https case
- "returns true for http URLs": duplicate of the https case (medium)
- "joins local filename with lineageId directory": path.join mirror, asserting only toContain (medium)

#### apps/local/app/services/video-posting-context.server.test.ts

- "returns null pitchId for standalone videos": only ever asserts null; it would pass with pitchId hard-coded to null (medium)
- "returns null pitchId for lesson videos": same (medium)
- "returns files from lineageId-keyed dir for lesson-bound videos": defaultEnabled is already pinned by the standalone test and video-files "decides defaultEnabled from the basename" (medium)
- "returns empty files array when directory does not exist": video-files listVideoFiles "returns an empty array when the video has no directory" (medium)

#### apps/local/app/services/youtube-upload-service.test.ts

- "includes notifySubscribers=true in the initiation URL when set": the same parameter echo as the false case (medium)

### Delete details

#### apps/local/app/services/changelog-service-empty-sections.test.ts (3 tests)

- "does not report changes when versions only differ by a removed empty section": its own comment says the fixture holds no empty section, which makes it identical to changelog-service "shows no significant changes when nothing changed"
- "returns no spurious changes for matching real sections": the same fixture again, through detectChanges
- "correctly detects a deleted lesson when its only reference was from an empty section": plain lesson removal, covered by changelog-service "detects a lesson disappearing (section lost its path) as deleted" and "lists videos under deleted lessons"

### Consolidate details

#### apps/local/app/services/course-publish-service-batch-export.test.ts and apps/local/app/services/course-publish-service.test.ts

- Both carry a verbatim ~200-line `setup()` (PGlite seed, mock VideoProcessingService, layers). batch-export's header comment claims a "per-file harness convention", but the other 12 course-publish-service-*.test.ts files already share `setupPublishableCourse` from apps/local/app/services/course-publish-service-test-setup.ts. Move both onto it (it already supports `mockVideoProcessing`, `videoCount` and per-run render overrides). batch-export's `addVideo`/`runBatchExport` helpers stay local.
- course-publish-service.test.ts's last test hand-rolls a third copy of the layer stack. It goes away if the trim above is taken.

#### apps/local/app/services/course-publish-dropbox-sync.test.ts

- `setupSync` is a fourth copy of the seed and Dropbox-auth harness. Move it onto `setupUploads` in apps/local/app/services/course-publish-dropbox-upload-test-setup.ts, which already seeds Dropbox auth and the fake Dropbox. The 9 surviving tests then sit naturally beside course-publish-dropbox-upload.test.ts.

#### apps/local/app/services/course-publish-service-reuse-fallback.test.ts, course-publish-service-syllabus-only.test.ts, course-publish-dropbox-placeholder.test.ts, course-publish-service-pipeline.test.ts

- Each redefines `isVideoUploadRequest`, `remoteBundleVideoPaths` or `receiptManifest` locally. All three are already exported from apps/local/app/services/course-publish-dropbox-upload-test-setup.ts. Import them; no tests change.

#### clip-service-{sections,timeline,selection,selection-move,insertion-point,obs,effect-clips}.test.ts

- All 7 open with the same ~65-line harness (PGlite, createDirectClipService, the start/afterClip/afterSection/getItems helpers); 4 distinct md5s, differing only by one `end` constant. Extract it to apps/local/app/services/clip-service-test-setup.ts, mirroring course-editor-service-test-setup.ts. No test cases change. About 400 lines removed.

#### apps/local/app/services/export-hash-overlay-animation.test.ts and export-hash-camera-version.test.ts

- Both say they were split out of export-hash.test.ts only for a per-file token budget. After the trims above export-hash.test.ts loses about 7 tests, which may make room to fold the surviving 2 + 2 back in. Optional, low confidence.

### Trim details

#### apps/local/app/cli/cli-beat-writes.test.ts

- "add accepts --kind setup" — same flag path as "add accepts --kind, --title and --description atomically", just another enum literal
- "update never repositions or changes the beat's video" — service rule; update has no position input
- "add echoes an empty learningGoalIds for a brand-new beat" — core "starts with no Learning Goals" plus the first test's echo
- "update --learning-goal (repeated) attaches every id given" — repeated-flag parsing already covered by "add --learning-goal (repeated)"; set semantics in core setBeatLearningGoals
- "add --before an unknown beat id => NotFoundError, exit 2" — core "fails when beforeBeatId does not exist"; move's unknown-anchor test covers the CLI path
- "update an unknown id => NotFoundError, exit 2" — same rule as "any write on an already-deleted beat"
- "delete an unknown id => NotFoundError, exit 2" — same as above

#### apps/local/app/cli/cli-learning-goal-writes.test.ts

- "create --before an unknown goal id => NotFoundError, exit 2" — core "fails when beforeLearningGoalId does not exist"

#### apps/local/app/cli/cli-clip-mockup-ordering.test.ts

- "clamps an anchor pushed off the end back to the clip's last moment" — front-clamp test proves wiring; end rule in core
- "leaves an in-bounds Overlay shifted but otherwise untouched" — core "shifts an in-bounds anchor and nothing more"

- "prints nothing (exit 0) for an empty directory" — shared empty-list contract

#### apps/local/app/cli/cli-integration.test.ts

- "lesson list carries name = title" — title fallback is helpers.test.ts; section/video tests already prove withName wiring
- "pitch list carries name = title (the noun the report was about)" — same

#### apps/local/app/cli/cli-lesson-video-writes.test.ts

- "create with missing --name => invalid input, exit 3" — framework required-option behaviour
- "update with no --name => invalid input, exit 3" — near-dup of "update with no fields => invalid input, exit 3"
- "update --description on an unknown video => NotFoundError(video), exit 2" — same as "update an unknown video => NotFoundError(video), exit 2"
- "an empty --title => invalid input, exit 3" (lesson update) — dup of cli-lesson-move-update "rejects an empty title as invalid input (exit 3)"

- "refuses two bullets revealed at the same moment" — core bullet-panel "refuses two bullets revealed at the same moment"
- "gives a bullet a whole extra ease when the exit is a cut" — core "accepts a whole ease later when the exit is a cut"

- "prints nothing for a Video with no Overlays" — shared empty-list contract
- "returns several Overlays as NDJSON" — shared emitGet contract
- "emits what it found and names what it did not" — shared emitGet contract

#### apps/local/app/cli/cli-pitch-beat-writes.test.ts

- "create with missing --title => invalid input, exit 3" — framework required-option behaviour
- "update rejects the retired --content-plan flag => exit 3" — unknown-option rejection is @effect/cli behaviour; the create one is enough to pin the retirement

#### apps/local/app/cli/cli-remote-auth.test.ts

- "fails when the token has expired" — core db-api-token-operations "rejects an expired token"; CLI-side indistinguishability covered by "says the same thing whichever it was"
- "fails when the token has been revoked" — same (core "rejects a revoked token")
- "advances lastUsedAt, so a token nobody needs is findable" — core "accepts a valid token and advances lastUsedAt"

- "rejects both --before and --after (exit 3)" (section move) — same rejectBothFlags as create's "both --before and --after => invalid input, exit 3"

#### apps/local/app/hooks/should-ignore-keyboard-shortcut.test.ts

- "allows shortcuts when not inside a dialog" — same as "allows shortcuts for a generic element outside a dialog"

#### apps/local/app/lib/popup-channel.test.ts

- "carries popup messages to the main app" — subsumed by "gives each side only the messages meant for it"
- "carries main-app messages to the popup" — same
- "opens a given url instead of the default" — pass-through of an argument to a mocked window.open

#### apps/local/app/lib/semver.test.ts

- "parses v0.0.0" — same parse rule as "parses a v-prefixed semver string"
- "bumps from v0.0.0" — same bump rules as the three bump tests

#### apps/local/app/packages/course-json/tests/course-json-validation.test.ts

- "includes faithful section title" — near-dup of "emits title on every section"
- "drops a section whose only lessons are withheld to-do lessons" — effective-sections "drops a section whose only lessons are withheld"

#### apps/local/app/packages/course-json/tests/course-json.test.ts

- "uses course id and name at the top level" — trivial field copy
- "uses lineageId as the lesson id" / "uses lineageId as the video id" — copy-paste of "uses lineageId as the section id"; fold all three into one test asserting the three ids

#### apps/local/app/packages/course-json/tests/lesson-publish-status.test.ts

- "offers exactly the four bands, in floor order" — `expect(PLACEHOLDER_FLOOR_BANDS).toEqual([...])`, restates the constant

#### apps/local/app/prompts/animatic-instructions.test.ts

- "wraps the Animatic in <animatic> tags under an Animatic heading" — mirrors the template
- "keeps mockup numbers from being cited as transcript clip indices" — prompt literal
- "tells the model to follow a comment about the output, and never quote the Animatic" — prompt literal
  (keep "returns empty string for no Animatic")

#### apps/local/app/prompts/beats-instructions.test.ts

- "returns empty string for empty beats" — whitespace test is a superset
- "wraps the beats in <beats> tags under a Beat Plan heading" — mirrors the template
- "demotes the beats to intended emphasis only" — prompt literal
- "tells the model a beat missing from the transcript was cut" — prompt literal
- "no longer presents the beats as the video's flow and structure" — prompt literal (negative)

#### apps/local/app/prompts/script-instructions.test.ts

- "wraps transcript in <transcript> tags" — mirrors the template
- "includes on-screen annotation explanation" — prompt literal
- "uses custom preamble when provided" — parameter pass-through + literal
  (keep empty and trailing-newline)

### Consolidate details

#### apps/local/app/cli/cli-lesson-move-update.test.ts

- Target: keep this file as the home for `lesson update` tests and remove the duplicates from apps/local/app/cli/cli-lesson-video-writes.test.ts (listed under its trims). Within this file also drop:
  - "reports a missing lesson as not-found (exit 2)" in the `lesson update --description` block — same update verb and path as the --title block's not-found test
  - "refuses to edit a lesson in a published version (exit 3)" in the `lesson update --description` block — same draft-guard call as the --title block's test

#### apps/local/app/lib/timeline-visibility.test.ts -> apps/local/app/lib/filtered-newest-snapshot.test.ts

- The latter already runs the same truth table through `isVisibleInTimeline` ("applies the SAME visibility filter the timeline does" plus the preserved/archived cases), so deleting this file loses nothing.

#### Cross-file note: --before/--after mutual exclusion

- `rejectBothFlags` (apps/local/app/cli/helpers.ts) is shared; each noun file has one or more "both --before and --after => exit 3" tests. Recommendation applied above: one per noun file (the extra per-verb copies are trimmed). A further step would be one it.each over all verbs in cli-integration.test.ts, but that does not shrink the suite much.

### Trim details

#### apps/local/app/features/article-writer/choose-screenshot-mutations.test.ts

- "handles decrementing clipIndex": same as "updates clipIndex in a tag"
- "returns false for empty string": the regex is one `.test()` call, and the no-tags case already covers this

#### apps/local/app/features/article-writer/remove-document-block.test.tsx

- "keeps the indentation of the sibling below a nested list item": no screenshot tag, so mapping is identity; dup of remove-markdown-block "takes the indent with a nested list item"
- "takes the quote marker when removing a blockquoted paragraph": dup of remove-markdown-block "takes the quote marker with a blockquoted paragraph"

#### apps/local/app/features/video-editor/beat-tab.test.ts

- "honours a persisted tab that still exists (reference)": same branch as the (beats) case
- "falls back to script when the persisted tab no longer exists (beats gone)": same branch as the (reference removed) case
- "defaults to script even when the video has beats": same as "defaults to script even when a reference is selected"
- "falls back to script when a stale beats tab was persisted and neither exists": same fallback branch
- "honours a persisted script tab (always available)": script always exists, so this is trivially the honour branch

#### apps/local/app/features/video-editor/clip-state-reducer-diagram-pin.test.ts

- "clears both fields when unpinning (setting null)": same assignment with null
- "overwrites an existing pin with a new one": same assignment
- "is a no-op when frontendId does not exist": generic map no-op

#### apps/local/app/features/video-editor/ensure-obs-profile.test.ts

- "does not call CreateProfile for missing profiles": "returns error when target profile does not exist" already asserts only GetProfileList was called
- "switches from TikTok to Landscape Recording": direction variant of the switch test
- "returns Landscape Recording for standard format": lookup table
- "returns TikTok for short format": lookup table

#### apps/local/app/features/video-editor/video-editor-selectors-capture.test.ts

- "is false with no sessions, no clips, OBS not running": covered by "is false when fully idle..."
- "is true when recording with pending clips and an active session combined": all three clauses true at once; tests nothing new
- "stays true through settling: OBS idle but a clip is still pending after stop": polling session alone already makes it true ("is true when a session is polling/settling...")

#### apps/local/app/features/video-editor/video-editor-selectors-chapters.test.ts

- "returns undefined when clip is not found in items": trivial findIndex edge
- "returns undefined for empty items": trivial edge

- "returns true when flag is set": getShowLastFrame is the identity function
- "returns false when flag is not set": identity function
- "finds the current clip": `clips.find` pass-through
- "returns undefined when not found": `clips.find` pass-through
- "returns true for empty array": `Array.every` semantics (third-party behavior)

#### apps/local/app/features/video-editor/video-editor-selectors-danger-metadata.test.ts

- "returns duration for on-database clips": getClipDuration is end minus start; already exercised via timecodes
- "returns null for optimistic clips" (getClipDuration): trivial branch

#### apps/local/app/features/video-editor/video-editor-selectors-retranscribe.test.ts

- "names every clip of the video that is already on the database": covered by the skip test's expected output
- "names an already-transcribed clip too — a re-transcribe redoes it": the selector never looks at text; tautological
- "is empty for a video with no clips": filter on empty

#### apps/local/app/features/video-editor/video-editor-selectors-timeline.test.ts

- "includes on-database clips": covered by "preserves order of remaining items"
- "includes chapters (on-database)": covered by "preserves order of remaining items"
- "returns empty array for empty input": trivial

- "ignores non-optimistic items": dup of "ignores ClipOnDatabase without shouldArchive (main timeline clips)"
- "returns empty array when no sessions exist": trivial

#### apps/local/app/features/video-editor/video-state-reducer.test.ts

- "should dispatch create-video-from-selection effect with selected clip IDs, title, and mode": subsumed by "should separate clip IDs and chapter IDs in the effect payload"
- "should dispatch effect with move mode when specified": pass-through of the `mode` field

### Consolidate details

#### apps/local/app/features/article-writer/writable-field.test.ts -> apps/local/app/features/article-writer/writer-engine-utils.test.ts

- Move "stores nothing but conversations" (storage-key hygiene) into writer-engine-utils.test.ts under "field messages localStorage persistence" (it needs the `key(index)`-capable mock).
- Drop the rest:
  - "restores messages to their pre-open state on cancel", "restores messages across all modes on cancel" and "apply does not revert messages (only cancel does)" re-implement the snapshot loop inline and test only save/load.
  - The keying-isolation tests duplicate the key-distinctness and "does not bleed" tests.
  - The constrainModes tests duplicate writer-engine-utils' constrainModes block.
  - The FIELD_MODES membership tests restate config.
- Then delete writable-field.test.ts.

### Delete details

- apps/local/app/features/video-editor/clip-state-reducer-recording-handler.test.ts (10): the private seam is duplicated at the public reducer seam.
- apps/local/app/features/video-editor/use-audio-boost.test.ts (8): tautological. It never invokes useAudioBoost. If the Strict Mode fix (fcdc392c) needs a guard, write one real renderHook test that mounts twice and asserts createMediaElementSource is called once.

### Trim details

#### apps/local/app/features/course-view/course-editor-helpers.test.ts

- "preserves order for any mix of IDs (no special-casing)" — dup of "preserves relative order of selected lessons"
- "counts a todo lesson that has videos with clips as todo" — videos are irrelevant to todo count since authoringStatus refactor; dup
- "counts a lesson with authoringStatus todo" — identical setup/assert to "counts a todo lesson with no videos"
- "counts all todos regardless of priority" — no filter means no priority logic; dup
- "counts all-done lessons as 100% even with videos absent" — dup of "reaches 100% only when no lessons are todo"

#### apps/local/app/features/course-view/dependency-drag.test.ts

- "adds dependency with empty initial dependencies" — dup of "adds dependency when target is not yet a dependency"
- "returns false for non-cyclic graph" — dup of "returns false when no path exists"

#### apps/local/app/features/course-view/lesson-title-editor.test.ts

All of these test logic re-implemented inside the test file (makeSaveTitle helper, inline handledRef/onFocus lambdas), never the component/hook — they cannot fail for a bug in the real code:

- "should allow blur-to-save after a previous Enter-to-save"
- "should NOT call onSave on blur after Escape cancels the session"
- "calls select() on the input element when focused"
- "submits update-lesson-title when title changes"
- "does not submit when title is the same as current"
- "does not submit when value only differs by surrounding whitespace"
- "preserves the user's exact casing rather than title-casing it"
- "falls back to lesson.path when title is empty — does not submit when value equals path"
- "submits multiple times when renamed repeatedly to different values"
  (If the saveTitle guard matters, extract it like buildSectionRenameEvent and test that.)

#### apps/local/app/features/course-view/optimistic-applier-composition.test.ts

- "returns loaderData unchanged for add-lesson" — same fall-through branch as create-section
- "returns loaderData unchanged for section events when selectedCourse is undefined" — dup of "undefined selectedCourse › returns loaderData unchanged"
- "returns loaderData unchanged when section has no lessons" — same seam as not-found
- "formats the key as course-editor:<type>:<id>" — string concat; covered by courseEditorFetcherKeyForEvent tests

#### apps/local/app/features/course-view/optimistic-applier-delete-video.test.ts

- "returns loaderData unchanged when sections array is empty" — dup of "videoId is not found"
- "formats the key with the delete-video prefix" — string concat; the startsWith-prefix test carries the contract

#### apps/local/app/features/course-view/optimistic-applier.test.ts

- update-lesson-title › "returns loaderData unchanged when lesson is not found" — same withPatchedLesson seam as update-lesson-icon's not-found

- update-section-description › "returns loaderData unchanged when section is not found" — same withPatchedSection seam as update-section-name
- "handles a lesson path without numeric prefix" — numeric prefix era is gone (d5999395); dup of "ignores whatever the lesson's previous path happened to be"
- "handles a new slug that contains hyphens" — same
  (Remaining one-line "patches X" tests could be a single test.each; optional.)

#### apps/local/app/features/course-view/section-grid-utils.test.ts

- "todo filter includes lesson with authoringStatus=todo" — dup of first todo-filter test
- "todo filter includes all priorities" — no priority filter applied; dup
- "works with two sections" — covered by up/down swap tests

#### apps/local/app/features/course-view/use-lesson-dependency-drag.test.ts

- "returns green ring for add action on drag target" — restates class table
- "returns amber ring for remove action on drag target" — restates class table
- "returns red ring for noop action on drag target" — restates class table
- "returns slate ring for existing dependency during drag" — restates class table

#### apps/local/app/features/course-view/video-warning-indicator.test.tsx

- "shows by default" — re-tests DEFAULT_VISIBILITY (course-view-visibility test 1)
- "hides with the Videos they hang off" — asserts only resolveEffectiveVisibility, never renders; dup of course-view-visibility test 3

#### apps/local/app/features/diagrams/cvm-icon-shape.test.ts

- "defaults to white, solid, and a square box" — restates getDefaultProps config

#### apps/local/app/features/upload-manager/consume-sse-stream.test.ts

- "passes correct fetch options" — mirrors the fetch call
- "returns an AbortController" — type-level trivia

#### apps/local/app/features/upload-manager/upload-manager-integration.test.ts

- "should recover params from unified map and call registry initiate on retry" — drives simulateEffect, a test-local copy of the real effect
- "should call initiate for each upload type with correct params" — same
- "should call initiate when dependency completes and status transitions from waiting to uploading" — same
- "should not call initiate when dependent fails due to dependency error cascade" — same (reducer half covered by deps "should fail dependent when dependency fails permanently")
- "should recover params for dependency-activated upload from unified param map" — same
- "should retry export type when paramsMap has no entry for the upload" — same
- "should have an entry for every upload type" — Record<UploadType,…> typing enforces it
  (Keep the 3 "full integration: reducer + registry through lifecycle" tests. If the effect wiring matters, extract it from upload-context and test the real function.)

#### apps/local/app/features/upload-manager/upload-reducer-deps.test.ts

- "should handle starting multiple uploads" — map insertion
- "should handle mixed statuses across uploads" — composes generic UPLOAD_SUCCESS/UPLOAD_ERROR cases already tested
- "should handle concurrent uploads across different types" — dup of generic "should create type-specific entries via registry for each upload type"

#### apps/local/app/features/upload-manager/upload-reducer-generic.test.ts

- START_UPLOAD › "should not affect existing uploads" — object spread
- UPDATE_PROGRESS › "should not affect other uploads" — object spread
- DISMISS › "should not affect other uploads" — object spread
- "should transition to retrying on second error" — dup of first-error case; boundary covered by "reaches 3"

#### apps/local/app/features/upload-manager/upload-reducer-stages.test.ts

- "should update export stage to queued" — dup of "should update export stage for existing upload"
- "should transition from creating-post to polling" — dup of "should update buffer stage for existing upload"

#### apps/local/app/features/upload-manager/upload-type-registry.test.ts

Keep: export createEntry/resetEntry/applySuccess (isBatchEntry/exportStage rules), youtube resetEntry (preserves youtubeVideoId), youtube applySuccess stores id, youtube initiate (wires startSSEUpload) and youtube "should abort existing controller before starting new one" (single copy of shared withAbortManagement), buffer createEntry/resetEntry/applySuccess stage rules. Remove (13):

- export › createEntry › "should preserve waiting status from base when dependsOn is set" — base spread, same for every type
- export › applySuccess › "should clear previous error message on success" — dup of generic "should clear any previous error message"
- youtube › "should be registered in the registry" — restatement
- youtube › "should have supportsDependsOn set to true" — restates config

- youtube › applySuccess › "should default youtubeVideoId to null when not provided" — `?? null`

### Consolidate details

#### apps/local/app/features/upload-manager/upload-type-registry-posting.test.ts -> apps/local/app/features/upload-manager/upload-type-registry.test.ts

- Delete the file. Its 22 tests are two identical blocks (ai-hero, skills-changelog) of: is-registered, supportsDependsOn flag, createEntry null-slug default, waiting preserved, resetEntry nulls slug (x2), applySuccess (x3), initiate abort management (x2) — all either config restatement or shared code (withAbortManagement, base spread, generic error clearing) already covered.
- Move one parametrised test into upload-type-registry.test.ts: `it.each([["ai-hero","aiHeroSlug"],["skills-changelog","skillsChangelogSlug"]])("applySuccess stores the posted %s slug")` — the only behaviour the UI reads (link to the posted article).

### Trim details

#### apps/local/app/features/animatic/animatic-chapters.test.ts

- "keeps each row's timeline index, so no key or highlight moves" — index preservation is covered by the harder under-divider case ("does not shift the indexes of the rows under the divider")
- "does not swallow the rows of the Chapter above it" — covered by "reads as zero and offers nowhere to seek to" plus "shows every Clip Mockup exactly once, wherever the dividers fall"

#### apps/local/app/features/animatic/animatic-collapse.test.ts

- "opens a closed one again" — same toggle rule as "opens with one click" / "closes it, and leaves every other Chapter as it was"
- "reads as 'expand' once all are closed" — already asserted in "is folded away, so the page opens on the dividers alone" (areAllChaptersCollapsed true) and implied by "opens every Chapter once all are closed"

#### apps/local/app/features/animatic/animatic-playback-rate.test.ts

- "offers no rate Remotion refuses" — asserts the contents of the constant table
- "falls back for a value Remotion would refuse" — same rule as "falls back for a rate the control does not offer" (parser accepts only listed rates); fold "0"/"-2" into that test if wanted

#### apps/local/app/features/animatic/animatic-progress.test.ts

- "is a share of whatever it is drawn inside, and zero before a frame is written" — mirrors a one-line template string

#### apps/local/app/features/animatic/animatic-selection.test.ts

- "steps over them on the way up as well" — mirror of "steps over the hidden rows on the way down"
- "selects the first row on screen rather than one behind a fold" — mirror of the "last" variant
- "moves exactly as before when an empty set says nothing is folded" — duplicate of "moves one segment at a time once a selection exists"

#### apps/local/app/features/animatic/animatic-transport.test.ts

- "leaves the Animatic playing" — same end state asserted in "plays on from the new frame when the Animatic was playing" and implied by the call-order test ending in play

#### apps/local/app/features/beats/beat-dnd.test.ts

- "reorders downward within a video (adjacent)" — b→c yields the same "move to end" outcome as "reorders downward within a video (non-adjacent)"
- "moves into an empty video via its container" — same container-append path as "appends when dropped on a video's container"

#### apps/local/app/features/beats/beat-learning-goals-picker.test.tsx

- "says so when the Section has no Learning Goals yet" — static empty-state copy

#### apps/local/app/features/deliverables-calendar/deliverable-grouping.test.ts

- "handles multiple items on the same day sorted by createdAt" — duplicate of "sorts items within a week by date asc, then createdAt asc"
- "returns only current week when all items are archived" — covered by "filters out archived items..." + "returns current week even when no items exist"
- "overdueCount is 0 when no overdue items in week" — asserted in "computes overdueCount per week group" (week21 = 0) and the integration test
- "archived overdue item excluded from both weekGroups and overdueCount" — archived filtering already covered by "filters out archived items from both weekGroups and pastHistory"
- "moves past cancelled items to pastHistory" — covered by "does not count done or cancelled as overdue even when past" and the integration test (d3)
- "keeps future-dated done items inline" — same rule as "keeps future-dated cancelled items inline, not in pastHistory"
- "preserves extra properties on extended types through grouping" — generic pass-through; a type-level concern

#### apps/local/app/features/publish/publish-blockers.test.ts

- "reads as one line of three counts" — string concatenation
- "has a label for every reason it can name" — asserts a lookup table (Record type already forces completeness)
- "keeps two courses' remembered floors apart" — key builder mirror

#### apps/local/app/features/teleprompter/script-markdown.test.tsx

- "linkifies a www address with no protocol" — remark-gfm autolink behaviour
- "linkifies an email address" — remark-gfm autolink behaviour
- "opens a link away from the glass" — duplicate of linked-text "opens links away from the glass"
- "keeps the prose around a link" — markdown renderer behaviour

#### apps/local/app/features/teleprompter/session-marks.test.tsx

- "preserves order when folding" — order already pinned by "never folds away an unlanded mark" (first/last asserts)
- "fills a landed dot and leaves an unlanded one hollow" — static inline-style assertion

#### apps/local/app/features/teleprompter/teleprompter-crawl.test.tsx

- "sets a cue block as written, brackets and all" — duplicate of script-blocks "keeps a cue block's brackets"
- "breaks a word too long for the measure instead of overflowing" — static CSS string
- "lets the script be selected" — static CSS string

#### apps/local/app/features/teleprompter/teleprompter-session.test.ts

- "shows the script when the editor is on the Script tab" — parallel copy of the Beats-tab test
- "shows the Animatic when the editor is on the Animatic tab" — parallel copy of the Beats-tab test
- "adopts what the editor pushed" (in describe "latest transcript") — field pass-through; the drop/clear tests carry the rules

#### apps/local/app/features/thumbnail-editor/thumbnail-state-reducer-capture.test.ts

- "should have correct initial state" — restates initial constants
- "open-camera: should set cameraOpen to true" — one-field setter
- "close-camera: should set cameraOpen to false" — one-field setter
- "background-removal-failed: should set error and clear removingBackground" — setter; fully covered by "background-removal-failed then retry: should recover and emit new effect"
- "diagram-pasted: should set diagramImage and diagramPosition" — duplicate of "diagram-pasted: works without capturedPhoto (diagram-first workflow)"
- "diagram-removed: should clear diagramImage" — one-field setter
- "diagram-position-changed: should update diagramPosition" — one-field setter
- "cutout-removed: should clear cutoutImage" — one-field setter
- "cutout-position-changed: should update cutoutPosition" — one-field setter
- "retry-background-removal: should clear error, set removingBackground, and emit effect" — subsumed by "background-removal-failed then retry: should recover and emit new effect"
  (Optional: parametrise the four "...should set pendingAutoSave when editingThumbnailId is set" tests into one test.each.)

- "save-succeeded: should preserve previewDataUrl" — one field of a reducer that doesn't touch it
- "save-failed: should set saving to false" — subset of "save-failed: should preserve editor state"
- "delete-failed: should clear deleting" — one-field setter
- "edit-failed: should clear loadingEdit" — one-field setter
- "edit-loaded: should handle thumbnail with no diagram or cutout" — same copy-through as "edit-loaded: should populate editor with loaded data"
- "new-thumbnail-clicked: should clear pendingAutoSave" — fold one assert into "new-thumbnail-clicked: should clear all editor state"
- "new-thumbnail-clicked: should clear previewDataUrl" — fold one assert into "new-thumbnail-clicked: should clear all editor state"
- "preview-updated: should set previewDataUrl" — one-field setter
- "preview-updated: should handle null (cleared preview)" — one-field setter

#### apps/local/app/features/video-posting/convert-short-links.test.ts

- "returns multiple distinct URLs" — covered by "handles mixed short and long links" + dedupe test
- "returns true for www variant" — www handling already covered in findConvertibleAiHeroUrls tests
- "replaces a single URL" — subsumed by "replaces all occurrences of a URL"
- "returns text unchanged when replacements map is empty" — trivial no-op

#### apps/local/app/features/video-posting/post-page-validation.test.ts

- "returns null for a single line with trailing newline" — same class as "returns null for a single line surrounded by blank lines"
- "returns null for a single non-empty line among blank lines" — duplicate of "returns null for a single line surrounded by blank lines"
- "returns error for multiple candidate lines separated by blank lines" — same rule as "returns error for two non-empty lines"

### Consolidate details

#### apps/local/app/features/deliverables-calendar/deliverable-grouping-buffer.test.ts

- Target: apps/local/app/features/deliverables-calendar/deliverable-grouping.test.ts (new `describe("overdueCutoffStr")` block reusing that file's `today`/`makeDeliverable`, which are copy-pasted here).
- Move: "buffer=1 week marks planned items within the next 7 days as overdue" (the cutoff boundary rule), "buffer does not count done or cancelled items as overdue even within buffer", "buffer does not affect pastHistory bucketing — only overdueCount changes".
- Drop: "buffer=0 reproduces default overdue behaviour (date < today)" and "buffer=0 with explicit cutoff=todayStr exactly matches no-option behaviour" — both restate the default overdue rule already covered by "computes overdueCount per week group".
