/**

 * belonging to a Video, ordered like a Beat.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY ONLY THE ROW. The frame itself is a PNG under
 * `{CLIP_MOCKUP_DIR}/{video.lineageId}/` and `imagePath` is relative to that
 * directory, but nothing here ever touches a disk: `@cvm/core` is deployed to
 * a box that has none. Copying the PNG in, resolving the directory and
 * refusing a path that escapes it all live in `apps/local`, which is where the
 * machine is. What this service guarantees is the ordering — the same
 * fractional-index keys `BeatOperationsService` uses, so a Clip Mockup can be
 * repositioned by the same `--before`/`--after` anchoring.
 *
 * THE ORDER SPACE IS SHARED with Clip Mockup Chapters, the dividers that group
 * an Animatic. So `createClipMockups` and `moveClipMockup` compute their keys
 * against `listAnimaticOrder` — the merged, sorted list of both nouns — not
 * against this table, and under `lockAnimatic`, so two writers on one Video
 * can never compute the same key.
