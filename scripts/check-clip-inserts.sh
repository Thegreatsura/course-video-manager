# A copy of a Clip must carry its Transcript Words, Clip Web Links and
# Overlays. copyClipsOntoVideo (packages/core/services/copy-child-rows.ts)
# does that, and the copy-path guards (copy-paths-table-guard.test.ts,
# copy-paths.round-trip.test.ts) hold every path in COPY_PATHS to it. A
# hand-written copy that is NOT in COPY_PATHS escapes both — so it can drop
# Clip children silently.
#
# Flags any insert into the clip table or a Clip child table (Drizzle
# `.insert(clips)`, `insertInChunks(tx, clips, …)`, or raw `INSERT INTO`)
# outside the allowlist below. Test files and test harnesses are exempt.
