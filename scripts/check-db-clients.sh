# Every database connection this repo opens goes through the connection guard
# (packages/core/db/connection-guard.ts): from a git worktree, no writable
# connection to a remote database. The guard only runs where a client is built
# by one of the GUARDED factories below — code that builds its own client, or
# reads the connection string itself, bypasses it.
#
# Flags, anywhere outside those factories and the ALLOWLIST:
#   TS/JS:  new Pool( / new Client( (bare or `pg.`), postgres(, neon(,
#           drizzle(, new PGlite(, and READS of process.env.DATABASE_URL /
#           DIRECT_DATABASE_URL (dot, bracket or destructured). Assigning or
#           deleting the variable is not a read and is not flagged.
#   Shell:  psql / pg_dump / pg_restore / pg_dumpall, and $DATABASE_URL /
#           $DIRECT_DATABASE_URL — shell cannot call the guard at all.
#
# Build a client through a factory instead:
#   app / server code   DrizzleService (@cvm/core/services/drizzle-service.server)
#   one-off DB scripts  scriptPgClient() / scriptDrizzle()
#                       (apps/local/scripts/script-database-url.ts)
#   tests               createTestDb() / createBlankDb() / withQueryLog()
#                       (packages/core/test-utils/pglite.ts)
#   the URL alone       resolveDatabaseUrl() (@cvm/core/db/database-url)
#
# Default: staged files (pre-commit). `--all`: every tracked file (CI), which
# also fails on an ALLOWLIST entry that no longer matches, so the list only
# ever shrinks.

# The factories that run the guard before they connect.
