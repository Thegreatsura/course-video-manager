# A path the app did not build itself — an absolute `filePath` read from the
# database, a path out of a request — must pass `assertUnder`
# (apps/local/app/services/assert-under.ts) before anything writes to it or
# deletes it. On a verify-cvm test clone the rows still name Matt's real
# files; the guard is what keeps a clone's save inside its run's scratch/.
#
# Flags every fs write, delete, rename or copy in apps/local/app/routes and
# apps/local/app/services — `fs.writeFile*`, `.remove`, `.unlink*`, `.rm*`,
# `.rename*`, `.copyFile*`, `.truncate`, `.appendFile*` on a file-system
# receiver, and `removeBestEffort(fs, path)` — whose destination is not a
# variable assigned straight from a guard:
#
#   const target = yield* assertUnderEffect(getVideoFilesBaseDir(), row.filePath);
#   yield* fs.writeFile(target, bytes);
#
# The guards are `assertUnder`, `assertUnderEffect`, and the two store
# resolvers that call it (`resolveVideoFilePath`, `resolveClipMockupPath`), or
# the guard called inline as the argument. Test files and harnesses are exempt.
#
# Writes that genuinely never see such a path (ffmpeg scratch files in the OS
# temp dir, a daemon's own lock file) are counted per file in ALLOWLIST below.
# The count must match exactly: one more is a new unguarded write (guard it,
# never raise the count); one fewer means the entry is stale (lower it, or
# delete it at 0). The list only ever shrinks — MAX_ALLOWLISTED is its ceiling.
#
# Default: staged files (pre-commit). `--all`: every tracked file (CI).
